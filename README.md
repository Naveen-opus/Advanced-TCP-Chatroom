# Advanced-TCP-Chatroom
This is a Python-based Secure Chat room with sophisticated features. The entire project is based on socket programming and is written in Python. Clients are made to connect to the server, which is then promoted to enter a nickname, following which the server is set to listening mode with a certain IP Address and Port number. The messages are then sent out to all of the clients who are present.

Among the new features are:
Admin can ban anyone from the Chat Room using the Kick feature.
Admin can prevent some members from re-entering the Chat Room by using the Ban feature. A List is created using these names.
